# Generative Models

Implementation of a collection of generative algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in PyTorch. Our goal here is not to implement different generative models efficiently, but rather to understand the core working mechanism. 

## Note

To make it easier, most of the implementation will be done using Kaggle Ipython Notebook or Google Colaboratory.

## Implementations
